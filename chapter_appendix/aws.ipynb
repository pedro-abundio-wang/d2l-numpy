    "# Using AWS Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Many deep learning applications require significant amounts of computation. Your local machine might be too slow to solve these problems in a reasonable amount of time. Cloud computing services can give you access to more powerful computers to run the GPU intensive portions of this book. In this section, we will show you how to set up an instance. We will use Jupyter Notebooks to run code on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The walkthrough includes a number of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Request for a GPU instance.\n",
    "1. Optionally: install CUDA or use an AMI with CUDA preinstalled.\n",
    "1. Set up the corresponding MXNet GPU version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process applies to other instances (and other clouds), too, albeit with some minor modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Registering Account and Logging In\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to register an account at https://aws.amazon.com/. We strongly encourage you to use two-factor authentication for additional security. Furthermore, it is a good idea to set up detailed billing and spending alerts to avoid any unexpected surprises if you forget to suspend your computers. Note that you will need a credit card.\n",
    "After logging into your AWS account, click \"EC2\" (marked by the red box in :numref:`fig_aws`) to go to the EC2 panel.\n",

    "you can select a nearby Asia Pacific region, such as Seoul or Tokyo. Please note\n",
    "that some data centers may not have GPU instances. \n",
    "\n",

    "| g4   | Turing T4   | inference optimized FP16/INT8 |\n",

    "All the above servers come in multiple flavors indicating the number of GPUs used. For example, a p2.xlarge has 1 GPU and a p2.16xlarge has 16 GPUs and more memory. For more details see *e.g.,* the [AWS EC2 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) or a [summary page](https://www.ec2instances.info). For the purpose of illustration, a p2.xlarge will suffice (marked in red box of :numref:`fig_p2x`).\n",
