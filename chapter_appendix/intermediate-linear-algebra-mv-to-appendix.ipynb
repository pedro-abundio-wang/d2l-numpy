    "\n",
    "If you have made it this far, and understand everything that we have covered,\n",
    "then you are ready to begin modeling.\n",
    "You already know nearly all of the linear algebra required\n",
    "to implement a number of many practically useful models\n",
    "and you can always circle back when you want to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a lot more to linear algebra, \n",
    "even as concerns machine learning.\n",
    "At some point, if you plan to make a career in machine learning,\n",
    "you will need to know more than the basics we just covered.\n",
    "Below, we hint at some useful, more advanced concepts.\n",

    "### Basic vector properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are useful beyond being data structures to carry numbers.\n",
    "In addition to reading and writing values to the components of a vector,\n",
    "and performing some useful mathematical operations,\n",
    "we can analyze vectors in some interesting ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important concept is the notion of a vector space.\n",
    "Here are the conditions that make a vector space:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Additive axioms** (we assume that x,y,z are all vectors):\n",
    "  $x+y = y+x$ and $(x+y)+z = x+(y+z)$ and $0+x = x+0 = x$ and $(-x) + x = x + (-x) = 0$.\n",
    "* **Multiplicative axioms** (we assume that x is a vector and a, b are scalars):\n",
    "  $0 \\cdot x = 0$ and $1 \\cdot x = x$ and $(a b) x = a (b x)$.\n",
    "* **Distributive axioms** (we assume that x and y are vectors and a, b are scalars):\n",
    "  $a(x+y) = ax + ay$ and $(a+b)x = ax +bx$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of special matrices \n",
    "that we will use throughout this book. \n",
    "Let's look at them in a bit of detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Symmetric Matrix** These are matrices where the entries below and above the diagonal are the same. In other words, we have that $M^\\top = M$. An example of such matrices are those that describe pairwise distances, i.e. $M_{ij} = \\|x_i - x_j\\|$. Likewise, the Facebook friendship graph can be written as a symmetric matrix where $M_{ij} = 1$ if $i$ and $j$ are friends and $M_{ij} = 0$ if they are not. Note that the *Twitter* graph is asymmetric - $M_{ij} = 1$, i.e. $i$ following $j$ does not imply that $M_{ji} = 1$, i.e. $j$ following $i$.\n",
    "* **Antisymmetric Matrix** These matrices satisfy $M^\\top = -M$. Note that any square matrix can always be decomposed into a symmetric and into an antisymmetric matrix by using $M = \\frac{1}{2}(M + M^\\top) + \\frac{1}{2}(M - M^\\top)$.\n",
    "* **Diagonally Dominant Matrix** These are matrices where the off-diagonal elements are small relative to the main diagonal elements. In particular we have that $M_{ii} \\geq \\sum_{j \\neq i} M_{ij}$ and $M_{ii} \\geq \\sum_{j \\neq i} M_{ji}$. If a matrix has this property, we can often approximate $M$ by its diagonal. This is often expressed as $\\mathrm{diag}(M)$.\n",
    "* **Positive Definite Matrix** These are matrices that have the nice property where $x^\\top M x > 0$ whenever $x \\neq 0$. Intuitively, they are a generalization of the squared norm of a vector $\\|x\\|^2 = x^\\top x$. It is easy to check that whenever $M = A^\\top A$, this holds since there $x^\\top M x = x^\\top A^\\top A x = \\|A x\\|^2$. There is a somewhat more profound theorem which states that all positive definite matrices can be written in this form."
